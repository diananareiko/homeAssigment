# Home Assignment for WSCSport üèÜ

## Overview

This assignment aims to build a mini ‚Äúscore‚Äù application that can display a story for each match.

A URL is provided to fetch the response containing a feed of matches with their highlights. (Do not add the JSON file to your Xcode project.)

The app provides the following main capabilities:

1. Displays all the matches and scores sectioned by leagues (mock design provided for reference, but not mandatory to follow).
2. Clicking on a match opens a **horizontal-based player** (similar to Instagram Stories), displaying relevant video pages[].

### Guidelines Implemented:

- Used only **Kingfisher** via SPM for image fetching.
- Filtered out games without a `wscGame` property.
- Filtered out all data without a `primeStory`.
- Extracted the final score from the last page in the `pages` array of `wscGame`.

## Implementation Details

- **UIKit as Root Application**: The main app structure is built using UIKit.
- **SwiftUI for Leagues & Scores**: The leagues and scores listing screen is implemented using SwiftUI.
- **UIKit for Stories Player**: The match highlights player is built using UIKit.

## Technology Stack

- **UIKit & SwiftUI**: Hybrid UI approach.
- **MVVM**: Clean architecture pattern for better separation of concerns.
- **Kingfisher**: Used for efficient image loading.
- **URLSession**: Handles API calls efficiently.
